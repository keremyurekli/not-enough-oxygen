Welcome to Not Enough Oxygen, a mod that changes minecrafts gameplay completely by adding various fluid and gas mechanics to the game. 


This mod will be the base of my upcoming modpack, i am planning to make it something similar to "Oxygen Not Included". But i am also planning to make this mod standalone supported, then it can be put into any modpack you like.

> Quick demonstration of fluid physics. Other features will be added over time.
